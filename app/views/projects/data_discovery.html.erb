					As an aspiring professional in the UX industry (both design and research), I have to be able to understand how products impact end users. I specifically chose Amazon as my topic for my Business Performance and Strategy module because of its dedication towards designing customer-centric products and services. My analysis took weeks of research and from multiple sources including company reports, research papers, business books and blogs. I was able to write a paper that dissected every aspect of the company's core strategies between 2007 and 2012 and conclude where Amazon would stand in the following years.
