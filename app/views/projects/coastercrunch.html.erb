			CoasterCrunch is an app that was brainstormed at RIT. The main objective of the application is to create a less stressful theme park experience by utilising special passes in a digitized form, information on rides so theme park visitors can plan their trips accordingly, the option to create groups and meetups with friends and family at the theme park and an AR experience that includes an in-built gaming module which can be used to fight boredom during long lines as well as redeem points for prizes.
